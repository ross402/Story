Long ago, there was a valient prince who watched over his father, the king. The king
was getting very old, but his excess wealth allowed for prestine treatment from the
best doctors in the town. The prince was always with princess Elizabeth whom he loved
with all his heart. Then one day when the prince was in the fields with Elizabeth, a
armed guard approaced him, warning him that his father was in critical condition and they
didn't know if he would make it. The prince and princess sprinted back to the castle to find 
his father, who didn't make it. 

The prince could not believe it. For some reason, though he knew his father was ill, he never thought the man would actually die. There were thousands of people standing in the palace courtyard in a somber fashion. The kids and the women were crying loudly while the men stood in silence. The prince, unsure of how to react with so many people around, escaped through the alleyway and went to the river to collect his thoughts.

He knew what this meant.  He was next in line to be King.  How would he handle?  Would people like him? What would he change?  His mind was racing with very few
conclusions actually being reached. Less than 24 hours later, the prince was officially welcomed to what was his childhood home to rule over the land. His life
was changed forever.  With those same questions still clouding his mind, the thought of Elizabeth came back into his head.  He knew what he must do.  He needed to 
propose to Elizabeth.  He needed help with ruling his new kingdom.  So that's what he did.  The following day, the prince proposed to Elizabeth and made her his
queen.  The two ruled over the land for many years to come and lived happily ever after.
