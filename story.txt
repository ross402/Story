Long ago, there was a valient prince who watched over his father, the king. The king
was getting very old, but his excess wealth allowed for prestine treatment from the
best doctors in the town. The prince was always with princess Elizabeth whom he loved
with all his heart. Then one day when the prince was in the fields with Elizabeth, a
armed guard approaced him, warning him that his father was in critical condition and they
didn't know if he would make it. The prince and princess sprinted back to the castle to find 
his father, who didn't make it.
